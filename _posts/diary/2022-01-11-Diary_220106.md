## Snowy Weather

I started to contact with my friend who had lived in Anseong but now in America.
She got a job at Fashion Company, really good to hear it.
We talked recent situation for a while.
<br>
On that way, I suggested her to talk only with english. Me too, also.
It was hard to express my thoughts, but really helpful for my english work.
I knew that 'idk' means 'i don't know'. 
Also to talk each other with english, no matter how good at speaking out.
Just try, it flows somehow. Thanks for my old friend reminding me to converse in english. 
It has hardened in my brain for a long long time.
<br>
I decide to chatting with her regulary in English if she wants.
