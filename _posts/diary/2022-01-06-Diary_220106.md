This is my second day in Study Cafe Zone. 
I just start to run My blog. What i want to do is posting what I studying,
translating pop song lyrics and studying english.

My english will get better soon :)

In that sense, I translate one of the pop song, Shortly.

```
Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?
```

This is lyrics beginning of <span style="color:blue"> *lose yourself - Eminem*. </span>
I think this lyrics saying to me in the present situation. 
I try to look for a job, and now is the golden time to getting job properly.
This is my one shot that i grab. Also, The lyrics question to me. Capturing or slipping...
