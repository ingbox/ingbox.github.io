## Cold Weather

When I was elementary school I dreamed to be a venture worker.<br>
I thought that word 'venture' looks fascinating.<br>
Just method of answering question for "what's your dream?"<br>
Since, That's not my real dream, no more progress going on for developing my dream. <br><br>

Also, I didin't have any interest in my major. My SAT score put me entering mine University.<br>
Are those all my choice? In Future, I can't live my life passive.

Circumstance changing must required to me and having sense of crisis. <br>
Crisis follow climax man. But no crisis leads nothing. <br>
