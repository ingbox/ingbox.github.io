## Snowy Weather

I got a new hobby. Reading [r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/) is so interesting to me.<br>
It is reddit channel that addresses some mistery contents, horror contents and etc.<br>
I read the person who experienced dark web to earn some money by selling his body.<br>
Dark side in real life put me interested more. When I have a time I want to go dark web just for exploring.<br>
Not alone with my friends. It's scary, though.<br>

Also, I'm reviewing what i learned in k-digital last year by choosing only good course.<br>
I watched the course named "learning about bit-coin", not for invesing, regarding engineering.<br>
When we buy bit-coin in up-bit, that is common sense as stock concept. Not written on block nodes.<br>
For Real BTC trading, we have to use BTC purse individually.<br>
But I have no intention of traing BTC ever. I want to start just stock trade now.ðŸ˜ƒ
